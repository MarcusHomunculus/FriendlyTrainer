# Friendly Trainer
is the Trainer for you if you just want to start to exercise regularly.
Instead of just tracking your progress you also get a motivational
"feedback" on your exercise you just entered.

## Usage
You can open a specific view by clicking on it

### Add Result
Allows to add an entry for the repetitions you achieved that day. Just insert the number you
counted and _confirm_ the input to store it.  
If you're motivated and repeat the same exercise multiple times through the day your counts for
that day get summed up.

### Progress
Shows you your registered repetitions for the respective day in a graph.
This way you can see the your steady progress.  
If you're just starting out this view is locked until you entered data for 2 different days.

## Get the app
In the Play store the app is currently in closed testing and therefore not intended for public use.
